Woo Store Vacation allows you to put your WooCommerce shop on pause or hold mode for a certain amount of time.

== Description ==
It might be difficult for a store owner to find a time and take a vacation, but when they do they need a plan for their online store.

Store Vacation plugin provides a robust and missing feature of the WooCommerce core out of the box by allowing the site manager to schedule a range of vacation dates and putting eCommerce functionality of the site on pause or hold mode for a certain amount of time.

Pausing your store disables the checkout but keeps your store online and accessible to visitors. You can pause or temporarily close your store by defining a few simple options within a minute or two. This means customers can see your products but can't purchase them.

If you want to start selling products again, then you can unpause your store at any time by deactivating the Vacation Mode or schedule the plugin which does this behind the scenes for you automatically!

== Installation ==
= Minimum Requirements =

* PHP version 7.2 or greater.
* MySQL version 5.6 or greater or MariaDB version 10.0 or greater.
* WordPress version 5.0 or greater.
* WooCommerce version 3.4 or greater.

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option — WordPress will handle the file transfer, and you won’t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of the plugin, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu, and click “Add New.”
 
In the search field type “Woo Store Vacation”, then click “Search Plugins.” Once you’ve found the plugin, you can view details about it such as the point release, rating, and description. Click “Install Now,” and WordPress will take it from there.

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method requires downloading the plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favorite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](https://wordpress.org/support/article/managing-plugins/#manual-plugin-installation "Manual plugin installation").

= Updating =

Automatic updates should work smoothly, but we still recommend you back up your site.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Why you might want to put your store on vacation? =
This feature would be helpful in case:

* You are traveling or ill.
* You are temporarily unable to run your shop.
* You need a quick break to catch up on current orders.

= Does vacation mode hurt SEO ranking? =
Not at all! Unlike similar eCommerce platforms, the plugin is intended to keep your search engine rank intact and enabling this feature will not impact your place on SERP (Search engine results page).

Similar tricks such as increasing your delivery time with respect to the number of days you are taking a vacation are not necessary, and you may schedule your shop to be closed at any time.

= Where do I find the plugin’s settings page? =
1. Log into your WordPress website dashboard.
2. Navigate to “WooCommerce” » “Store Vacation”.

= How do I set up my vacation dates? =
1. Navigate to “WooCommerce” » “Store Vacation”.
2. Check the checkbox “Set Vacation Mode” to enable vacation mode in your shop.
2. Enter the “Start Date” (first day) of your vacation.
3. Enter the “End Date” (last day) of your vacation.
4. Optionally, fill in a temporary shop announcement or vacation message.
5. Click “Save Changes”.

= What does “Disable Purchase” checkbox do? =
Enabling this option will disable eCommerce functionality and takes out the cart, checkout process and add to cart buttons with disabling purchases for all users whether they’re logged in or not.

= Why there is no message displaying on my theme!? =
This is mainly because the theme author of yours has been overridden WooCommerce template files and modified the default order of the hooks in the shop and product view page — Consider switching to the “Storefront” theme.
